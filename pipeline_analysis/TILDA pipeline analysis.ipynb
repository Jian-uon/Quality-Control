    "# The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)\n",
    "1. The age distribution of the Irish population is undergoing a dramatic change at present and this trend is predicted to continue into the future. People are living longer, and older persons represent a larger proportion of the population.\n",
    "2.  a large prospective cohort study of ageing, which includes an assessment of the social, economic and health circumstances of community-resident older people living in Ireland.\n",
    "3. Begin in Oct 2009 and compelted in Feb 2011 \n",
    "4. A multi-stage probability sample of addresses are selected across the Ireland\n",
    "5. All household residents aged >=50 years were eligible to participate in the study\n",

    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "(i) the description of the current economic, social and health circumstances of older people living in Ireland and the creation of a longitudinal database with a combination of social, economic and health data to allow the monitoring of\n",
    "changes in health and well-being over time and \n",
    "(ii) the exploration of the complex interrelationships between numerous potential risk factors and protective factors and their impact on longevity and healthy ageing including for example: \n",
    "(a) the role of early childhood experiences on\n",
    "physical and mental health in later life;\n",
    "(b) the relationship between physical activity,\n",
    "obesity and frailty;\n",
    "(c) the influence of mood disturbances including anxiety and depression on cognitive\n",
    "and physical health; and\n",
    "(d) the effect of cognitive impairment on\n",
    "financial decisions around retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data collection\n",
    "(i) A computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) by trained social interviewers in participants' own homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) A self-completion questionnair(SCQ) in participants' own time\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) A comprehensive health assessment in a dedicated health centre, or a modified version delivered in the participantâ€™s home.A notable change to the health assessment was the addition of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain sub-study in Wave 3.\n",

    "TILDA has rich data on neurocognitive function,mental health,cardiovascular function, kidney function, locomotion, falls, fear of falling, vision, socioeconomic status and social circumstances, obtained during multiple waves of data collection."

    "## Fieldmap processing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determining the type of the images from scanner [fslinfo], only ANALYZE and NIFTI format are accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "dcm2niix . -o analysis DICOM\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Getting the magnitude image (A complex image can be converted into its phase and magnitude components by using [fslcomplex]) and Check that the magnitude image and the phase/fieldmap images have the same resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "fslmaths fieldmap_mag1 -add 3.14 fieldmap_magshift1  \n",
    "fslmaths fieldmap_mag2 -add 3.14 fieldmap_magshift2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Brain extraction to fieldmaps to get a tight brain mask which must exclude all non-brain voxels and any voxels with only a small partial volume contribution. The reason for this is that these areas are normally very noisy in the phase image \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "bet fieldmap_magshift2 fieldmap_mag_brain -f 0.6 -g -0.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Getting (warpped) phase in radians, because it can be converted into Hz or Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Unwarpping the phase images within the brain mask, i.e. use PRELUDE to do the required phase unwrapping\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Regularising the fieldmap. Fieldmaps can often be noisy or be contaminated around the edges of the brain. To correct for this you can regularise the fieldmap using [fugue]. (fugue performs unwarping of an EPI image based on fieldmap data).\n",
    "    Some regularisation options are - Gaussian smoothing, despiking and median filtering. Examples of these (in order) are:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    fugue --loadfmap=fieldmap_rads -s 1 --savefmap=fieldmap_rads\n",
    "    fugue --loadfmap=fieldmap_rads --despike --savefmap=fieldmap_rads\n",
    "    fugue --loadfmap=fieldmap_rads -m --savefmap=fieldmap_rads\n",
